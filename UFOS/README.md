# UFOS
This week I had the amazing oppurtunity to create a webpage and dynamic table for Dana. Using HTML we successfully curated a website to retrieve and read specific information about UFO sightings across the world. This webpage is not only informative but cool to use and look at!
## Results
After selecting a specific date, State, Country and City, youll be able to pull the UFO sightings in that area. You can go by each individual filter to observe the information from the data.js file. The website is inteded for those who want information about recorded UFO sightings. 

Search By State:

## Summary
This webpage works as intended however one thing I would like to change is how you view the information. if I had enough time I would see if I could add links to the comments/ results of the search for a more in depth description of the sightings. How cool would that be! Furthermore if there were images to further back up those sightings I think the website would be more dynamic and engaging.
